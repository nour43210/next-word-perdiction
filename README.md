✨ Project Description – "Next Word Prediction with R: Type Smarter, Not Harder!"
Imagine typing a message and having your keyboard magically suggest exactly what you're about to say. That’s the idea behind Next Word Prediction, a smart text suggestion engine built entirely in R — blending the art of language with the science of data.

In this project, I trained an NLP model using a massive dataset of blogs, news articles, and tweets, simulating how real people speak and write. After extensive text cleaning, I built powerful N-gram models (from unigrams to quadgrams) that analyze patterns in word sequences.

The core engine uses a "stupid backoff" algorithm — smart in simplicity — to predict the next word based on what the user types. If it can’t find a match in the highest N-gram, it gracefully falls back to smaller ones, ensuring a seamless experience.

To make it interactive and fun, I built a sleek Shiny web app, where users can type any sentence and instantly get their next word predicted — just like a mini AI keyboard!

🚀 Why It Stands Out
📚 Uses real-world language from social media, blogs, and news

🧠 Implements NLP from scratch in R (no deep learning required!)

⚙️ Shows off efficient text processing, tokenization, and modeling

🌐 Built with Shiny for an interactive and user-friendly web experience
